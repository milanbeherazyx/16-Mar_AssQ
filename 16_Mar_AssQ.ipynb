This happens when the model is too complex, with too many parameters, and has learned the training data too well. Consequences of overfitting include low accuracy on new data, high variance, and poor generalization.\n",

    ">Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and testing data. This happens when the model is too rigid or has too few parameters to learn from the data. Consequences of underfitting include high bias and low accuracy on both training and testing data.\n",

    "\n",
    "- 2.Effect on Model Performance: A high bias model is one that is too simple and doesn't capture the complexity of the data, leading to underfitting. A high variance model, on the other hand, is one that is too complex and fits the training data too closely, leading to overfitting. Both high bias and high variance can result in poor model performance.\n",
